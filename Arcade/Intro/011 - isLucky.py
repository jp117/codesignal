Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.

Given a ticket number n, determine if it's lucky or not.

Example

For n = 1230, the output should be
isLucky(n) = true;
For n = 239017, the output should be
isLucky(n) = false.

[input] integer n

A ticket number represented as a positive integer with an even number of digits.

Guaranteed constraints:
10 â‰¤ n < 106.
